[mod-setting-description]
biter-spire-minimum-base-size=The minimum amount of biter spawners needed in a base for a biter spire to spawn.\n\nNote: The mod checks a 3x3 chunk area for biter spawners. The higher this value is, the rarer biter spires will be.\n\nMinimum: 1 / Maximum: 1000 / Default: 10
biter-spire-base-generation=The base value for power generated by the biter spires in Watts (W). This value scales with the distance from spawn if "Scale with distance" is set to "true".\n\nMinimum: 1W / Maximum: 1PW / Default: 10MW
biter-spire-scale-with-distance=Determines whether the base value for power generation is scaling with the distance to spawn (0,0). \n\nDefault: true
biter-spire-distance-scale-factor=The factor that is multiplied with the distance and the base value. The formula is power_generated = base_value * (1 + distance_scale_factor * distance). The distance is calculated using the max-norm.\n\nNote: By default the biter spire will output twice the base power at 1000 tiles, three times the base power at 2000 tiles, and so on. (Linear Scaling)\n\nMinimum: 0 / Maximum: 100 / Default: 0.001
